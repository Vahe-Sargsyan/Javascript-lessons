# Resumption of Javascript lessons

Hello, I am Vahe. Python programmer, but before learning the Python programming language, I was studying Javascript on an amateur level. But now that I have decided to resume my research, I aim to increase my Javascript knowledge in the shortest possible time and why not reach a senior level.
